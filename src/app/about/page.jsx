        <p className="text-sm ">
It all started with a T-shirt painting that she made for her sister and who knew that a birthday gift for her sister would give her an amazing venture idea.
‚ÄúI need to leave my job‚Äù, she thought to herself. Part time painting and full time job was not something that was quite enough to quench her thirst for art. And that was the inception of Daminih Arts. 
          <br /><br />
         . Leaving her full time and well paying job was a tough decision to make, but it was necessary so she could find herself. She wanted to do more, she wanted to be more, she wished to spread her wings and fly and not be caged forever. She wanted to paint till her hands couldn't any more. She wanted to paint till her monochromatic dreams become full of colours. She wanted to paint till the whole world recognizes and appreciates her art. 
          <br /><br />
          ‚ÄúI wanted to paint, that‚Äôs all. I don‚Äôt know how, where and on what‚Äù, she said. 
          <br /><br />No wonder she was a fan of the great Van Gogh. She figuratively inherited his craze. 
          <br /><br />She started with t-shirts then also began painting on bags, purses, pouches, walls, wood i. e pretty much everything that could be painted on, and she has never stopped since then. Today she has hundreds of happy customers and many more to come. The journey hasn't been easy at all for her, being all on her own but she found a way to crawl towards her dream through all the obstacles and challenges because she never lost sight of her dream.
          <br /><br />Today Daminih has established herself in T-shirt Painting, Painting Workshops, Wall Paintings and Illustrations.

        <p className="text-sm leading-7">
         Big wall, wooohhh!!! Big space to paint. It‚Äôs always exciting to see a big wall and more exciting when you get a chance to paint on it. Plain old painted walls are so boring and dull. Wall paintings are a forgotten art which once used to give royals and kings the feelings of benevolence, calmness, inspiration etc. Your walls can shape your ideas and your thoughts. Wall paintings also set the mood for you and you will just love it when you come back home from a tiring day and see all the beautiful walls and relax, have tea or coffee. The serenity of this experience cannot be explained in words and you should definitely try it to know what it feels like. You can call us if you want to fill your home or work place with memories. You can add a beautiful landscape in your living room or turn your kid‚Äôs room intoan animated world. We would love to do it for you.
          <br /><br />
          Experience the royal, calming effect of personalized wall art. Let your walls speak.
